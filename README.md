# Sorting Suite - Bubble Sort

* Bubble sort works by comparing and possibly swapping two values in an array

## Development Process

1. How will you know when the problem is solved?
* When we give our program an unsorted array and it returns to us a sorted array

2. How will it be used? It's interface? What do you put in and what do you get
out?
* It will be used within a program file or pry. We would instantiate a sorter
object and have a sort method that takes in an array and returns an array.

3. What is the most trivial use case? (mvp-mvp)
* The most trivial use case is that we create a sorter that takes in an empty
array and returns an empty array. After that, we could pass in an array with one
element and get back an array with one element.

4. What's the minimum work case?
* The minimum work case is that we pass in an array with two elements and it
returns to use the array with the two elements sorted.

5. What's the next most complex case?
* The next most complex case would be that we give our sorter an array of three
elements and it returns a sorted array of those three elements.

5. What's the next most complex case?
* The next most complex case would be passing an array of n length to our sorter
and it returns the array in proper order.

5. What's the next most complex case?
* The last thing I would like to implement if I have time is to only sort up to
the elements that have not "bubbled" to the end of an array.


6. Sketch an algorithm in pseudocode.
  1. Instantiate a bubble sort object
  2. pass in an empty array into the sort method
  3. Have the method return an empty array back to us

7. Implement

8. Whole Problem solved?
  * No? Return to 5

9. Anticipate problems / edge cases

10. Refactor

### Remember that 8 to 5 can repeat n times
